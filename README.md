# BulkPowerAutomateActivator
Bulk activate Power Automate flows (Cloud Flows) from Dynamics 365 solutions.  Save time by activating multiple flows at once instead of one-by-one.


KEY FEATURES:
- Select any solution (managed or unmanaged) from your connected environment
- View all Power Automate flows contained in the solution
- Activate or Deactivate multiple flows simultaneously with a single click
- Track activation progress with real-time status updates
- Change owner of power automate in bulk. [Use case when we restore a Dataverse environment and all the flows are owned by the user who created them. This feature will allow us to change the owner of all the flows in bulk to a service account or another user.]
- View detailed results and error messages for each flow
- Filter Power Automate flows by activation state (active/inactive)
- Reducing manual repetitive tasks during solution management or Dataverse envrionment restore.
- ALM scenarios requiring quick Power Automate flows activation

WHY USE THIS TOOL:
Manually activating Power Automate Flows one-by-one through the Dataverse or Power Automate interface is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with solutions 
containing dozens of flows. This plugin streamlines the process, allowing system admins to activate and reassign all Power Automate flows in a solution with just a few clicks.

REQUIREMENTS:
- XrmToolBox version 1.2023.x or later
- Appropriate security roles to activate workflows in the target environment
- Dynamics 365 CE/Power Platform environment
